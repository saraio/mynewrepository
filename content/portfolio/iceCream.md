Ice cream is one of life's simple pleasures. Ice cream can be made without ice cream maker. 
In less than a minute you can make your own homemade ice cream using your blender or hand blender. No other equipment is required. 
Ice cream base can be made with just three ingredients and flavour it up with your mouth watering flavours and mix-ins.

### Ingredients
>

2. Heavy Cream 1 pint/475 ml 
3. Vanilla essence 1 teaspoon
4. Unsweetened Cocoa powder 1/2 cup (for chocolate ice cream only)


![This is me][1]

### Ice Cream base

* Get a mixing bowl and pour the whole can of (14oz.) condensed milk into the mixing bowl
* Add the 1 teaspoon of vanilla
* Add 1/2 cup of swifted unsweetened cocoa powder (for chocoloate ice cream only)

### whipped Cream with blender

* Freeze the blender for 15 mins before making the whipped cream
* Pour 1 pint (2 cups) of heavy cream into the frozen blender.
* Mix/beat cream on highest setting until cream looks like whipped cream. 
  Do not over beat the cream it will start to turn into butter.

### Chocolate ice cream

* Keep the whipped cream in the same mixing bowl or transfer into a different mixing bowl. I opted to transfer to a different bowl.
* Fold in the ice cream base into the whipped cream a little at a time. Folding gently not to deflate the whipped cream
* Add any mix-ins like nuts, semi chocolate chips if needed
* After mixing transfer the mix into a plastic container cover with plastic wrap and then cover with the container cover
* Place in the freezer for 6 hrs or more, Depending on how hard you want your ice cream to be.ï»¿
