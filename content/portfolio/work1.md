Ginger helps to relieve common colds. It is also most commonly known for its quick relieving effects on heartburn, nausea, upset stomach, diarrohea, motion and morning sickness. It has been found to be a beneficial anti-inflammatory, due to its high levels of gingerol, making it a great natural remedy for headaches, minor body aches and even some cases of arthritis. Ginger also provides relief from morning sickness.
